# Cache Design LLD
Low Level design for Cache using Java, Kotlin

## Problem Statement

The cache should support the following operations:
* **Put**: Save a value against a key in the cache.
* **Get**: Get back the previously saved value using te same key. 
<p>
Cache should also support removal of keys in case cache is full, and we try to add new key value.We're using LRU cache eviction policy here.

### Expectations
* Code should be functionally correct.
* Code should be modular and readable. Clean and professional level code.
* Code should be extensible and scalable. .
* Code should have good OOPs design and SOLID principles
* Test cases to test the overall functioanlity
